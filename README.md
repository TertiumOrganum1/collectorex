# collectorex
a tool to replace 3ds max resoource collector and more


After more than 10 years I've finally decided to turn collectorex from internal utility to a public open source project. In the beginning it was paid utility, now it's completely free and not binded to hardware.
Please feel free to edit code and commit here, use it as you like, distribute it freely, I just don't allow to sell my software as your own. That's it.
